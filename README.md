# Worldometer-Covid-19-Analysis-Report
## This analysis aims to explore the rate at which continents were affected during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic

# Project Background
2020 was a challenging year, highlighted by the compulsory lockdown, high fatality rates, and a weak economy. What began as a China-specific emergency became a global one. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is the infectious disease known as coronavirus disease (COVID-19). The virus can spread from a person’s mouth or nose in tiny liquid particles when they speak, sing, sneeze, or cough. These particles range in size from larger respiratory droplets to microscopic aerosols. Anyone can contract COVID-19 and become gravely ill or die at any age (source: WHO). This analysis aims to explore the rate at which continents were affected during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic

## Data Sourcing: The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle

## Data cleaning: The dataset was loaded into PowerBI and transformed using the power query. The dataset contained 209 rows with 18 columns. No duplicate values were found, and each column datatype was carefully cross-checked.

## Analysis Technique: For this project, the 5 whys method was used to identify the ROOT cause of the problem.

The 5 Whys technique is a simple and effective tool for solving problems. The primary goal is to find the exact reason that causes a given problem by asking a sequence of “Why” questions. The 5 Whys method helps your team focus on finding the root cause of any problem.

# Problem: Which continent was most affected by the COVID-19 epidemic?

All countries, rich or poor, make efforts to improve the health of their populations, not at the same rates or with the same success, but most attempt to reduce mortality and increase health (Girosi & King, 2007). One of the greatest hits a continent can experience during the COVID-19 pandemic is a high mortality rate. How well did the continent manage their situations? The mortality rate leads to a negative effect on a continent. What’s the mortality rate?

# First why: which continent had the highest mortality rate?

To respond, the total death rate per 1,000,000 people was used to describe the total number of people who died per 1 million people.

Based on the data provided, the total death rate for each continent was calculated by dividing the population * 1,000,000 by the total death rate per continent (by 1M).

Europe’s mortality rate was extremely high compared to other continents. Why Europe? Why do they have a high death rate? These are the questions that were looked into below.

## Second Why: What caused the high death rate

Apart from death being natural due to God’s timing, causes of death can be grouped into three categories: communicable (infectious and parasitic diseases and maternal, perinatal, and nutritional conditions), noncommunicable (chronic), and injuries. Most deaths are caused by prolonged COVID-19 infection, which leads to respiratory failure of the lungs, heart, liver, intestines, kidneys, and genitals (Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome, MODS). The formation of a so-called “hyaline membrane” lining the lungs, which is composed of protein debris and dead cells, may worsen and shut down the lungs (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome, ARDS). Total serious cases means a list of those who have reached this critical point.


## Third Why: Why does Europe have a higher death rate than North America despite having fewer serious cases?

The risk of death from COVID-19 strongly depends on age and previous health conditions. Because the patients’ autopsy results or previous health conditions were not stated, the only pointer from the dataset is their recovery rate.

Europe’s recovery rate is higher than North America, but lower than Asia’s. Why this? It would have been expected that Asia being the first area of the world hit by the outbreak would lead to them being the most affected, but thanks to the early wide-scale response of some Asian states, this allowed them to fare comparatively well. Not all infected patients recovered at the same time, apart from those in critical condition, some were still undergoing treatments or isolation to confirm if they were COVID-free or not.

## Fourth why: Who had the most reported cases?


Europe had the highest total number of cases recorded. A reporter stated that ‘Central and Eastern regions were especially hard hit due to low vaccination rates and politicians reluctant to take tough measures to control the spread. ‘Western Europe too, a region with relatively high vaccination rates and good health care systems but where lockdown measure weren’t prioritized’. This means the sum of this is gotten from the number of people that did the test.

## Fifth why: What’s the testing rate?

A person infected with COVID-19 may not experience any symptoms and, without knowing it, can transmit the virus to others. Carrying out the test is a better way of knowing one’s status. Most people tested negative, while the majority tested positive.

## Conclusion
The COVID-19 pandemic mostly hit Europe, where there were the highest tested, had few serious cases and a fantastic recovery rate. When tested, it was found that there were many cases, which indicates that many people had contact with COVID-19 and spread it to others before noting the symptoms and getting tested.

Most region didn’t document their records effectively, which leads to low account for such region.

## Recommendation:

Government should enact and implement measures and policies to reduce the spread of covid 19 virus
Proper documentation should be made across all continent.
Get tested for COVID-19 as early as possible.
Staying Up to Date with COVID-19 Vaccines: COVID-19 vaccines help your body develop protection from the virus that causes COVID-19
Adhere strictly to hand and respiratory hygiene measures.
